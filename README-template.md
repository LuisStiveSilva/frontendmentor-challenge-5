### What I learned

I learned the background-blend-mode property. It was very useful for the image.

```scss
.image {
  background-image: url("../images/image-header-mobile.jpg");
  background-color: $softViolet;
  background-blend-mode: multiply;
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  filter: brightness(1.2);
}
```
